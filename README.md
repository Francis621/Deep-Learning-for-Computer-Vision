# Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision

##### 01_KNN_classifier:
             
A simple image processor was built, an image dataset was loaded into the memory and the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm was developed. The disadvantages of k-NN algorithm was discussed and moved on to parameterized learning.
             
##### 02_Linear_example:

A worked example is solved here. The random state of the python script to generate the weights that would lead to the correct classification was purposely set. We discuss the requirement of an optimization algorithm and go to next chapter.
             
##### 03_optimization_and_regularization:

Implemented vanilla gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent from sratch with L1 and L2 regularization.
